CVE-2019-25210,"An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm through 3.13.3. It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security concern in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values). Also, it is not the Helm Project's responsibility if a user decides to use --dry-run within a CI/CD environment whose output is visible to unauthorized persons.","March 03, 2024; 4:15:49 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-25210

i2c: Fix a potential use after free

CVE-2019-25160,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlabel: fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

There are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in
cipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(), the other in netlbl_bitmap_walk().  Both
errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.

As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8,
you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to
cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist before
Linux v4.8.","February 26, 2024; 1:15:06 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-25160
