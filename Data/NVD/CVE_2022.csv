CVE-2022-34321,"Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.

The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to ""Cluster"" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed.

2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.
3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.
3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses.","March 12, 2024; 3:15:47 PM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-34321

The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else

not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:

    kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null

CVE-2022-48629,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled

The generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can
be reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:

    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE

The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all
zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.

Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns
with a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have
qcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.

Here's some statistics from the ent project
(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
quality of the generated numbers:

CVE-2022-23087,"The e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an Ethernet packet when it is being transmitted.  These include the insertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN header, and TCP segmentation offload (""TSO"").  The e1000 device model uses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when simulating these modifications on transmitted packets.

When checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the e1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset in the on-stack buffer.  The offset was not validated for certain packet types.

A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on the host, possibly leading to code execution in the host context.

The bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on the FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of exploiting this issue.","February 15, 2024; 12:15:09 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23087
