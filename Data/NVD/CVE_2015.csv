CVE-2015-20110,JHipster generator-jhipster before 2.23.0 allows a timing attack against validateToken due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that is different. Attackers can guess tokens by brute forcing one character at a time and observing the timing. This of course drastically reduces the search space to a linear amount of guesses based on the token length times the possible characters.,"October 30, 2023; 11:15:07 PM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-20110

CVE-2015-8371,"Composer before 2016-02-10 allows cache poisoning from other projects built on the same host. This results in attacker-controlled code entering a server-side build process. The issue occurs because of the way that dist packages are cached. The cache key is derived from the package name, the dist type, and certain other data from the package repository (which may simply be a commit hash, and thus can be found by an attacker). Versions through 1.0.0-alpha11 are affected, and 1.0.0 is unaffected.","September 21, 2023; 2:15:11 AM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8371
