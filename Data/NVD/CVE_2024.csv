CVE-2024-0727|"Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
and PKCS12_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

CVE-2024-1019|ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs. ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it.

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see  RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no workaround for affected versions.|March 12, 2024; 2:15:07 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1410

When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret key using secure randomness.

CVE-2024-1635|"A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak."|February 19, 2024; 5:15:48 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1635

CVE-2024-1931|NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.|March 07, 2024; 5:15:07 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1931

CVE-2024-21584|Pleasanter 1.3.49.0 and earlier contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. If an attacker tricks the user to access the product with a specially crafted URL and perform a specific operation, an arbitrary script may be executed on the web browser of the user.|||
CVE-2024-21585|"An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in BGP session processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker, using specific timing outside the attacker's control, to flap BGP sessions and cause the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.


Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.
When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.

Memory can only be recovered by manually restarting bbe-smgd.

This issue only occurs if BFD liveness detection for DHCP subscribers is enabled. Systems without BFD liveness detection enabled are not vulnerable to this issue.

Indication of the issue can be observed by periodically executing the 'show system processes extensive' command, which will indicate an increase in memory allocation for bbe-smgd. A small amount of memory is leaked every time a DHCP subscriber logs in, which will become visible over time, ultimately leading to memory starvation.

CVE-2024-21629|Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm`, a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed).

CVE-2024-21631|Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. Prior to version 4.90.0, Vapor's `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when parsing a URI's components, which may cause integer overflows when parsing untrusted inputs. This vulnerability does not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating user input. The URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behavior to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted destination. By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result, spoof the host. Version 4.90.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, validate user input before parsing as a URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents` utilities.|January 03, 2024; 12:15:12 PM -0500|V3.1: 6.5 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-21631&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21631

Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`.|January 04, 2024; 3:15:25 PM -0500|V3.1: 6.1 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-21636&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21636

CVE-2024-21661|Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code, where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously, the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication, widening the pool of potential attackers.

CVE-2024-21662|Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account.

CVE-2024-22417|Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3 and prior, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343 in `requests.py`.

An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link.

CVE-2024-22419|Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur.

In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet.

CVE-2024-22424|Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible (but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-23330|"Tuta is an encrypted email service. In versions prior to 119.10, an attacker can attach an image in a html mail which is loaded from external resource in the default setting, which should prevent loading of external resources. When displaying emails containing external content, they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by the user. However, it could be recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded, even though the ""Automatic Reloading of Images"" function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user, since the user assumes that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the sender aware that the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was read, which device is used and expose the user's IP address.

CVE-2024-23331|Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript.

Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files.

CVE-2024-23332|The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains by using authentic container images and other OCI artifacts. An external actor with control of a compromised container registry can provide outdated versions of OCI artifacts, such as Images. This could lead artifact consumers with relaxed trust policies (such as `permissive` instead of `strict`) to potentially use artifacts with signatures that are no longer valid, making them susceptible to any exploits those artifacts may contain. In Notary Project, an artifact publisher can control the validity period of artifact by specifying signature expiry during the signing process. Using shorter signature validity periods along with processes to periodically resign artifacts, allows artifact producers to ensure that their consumers will only receive up-to-date artifacts. Artifact consumers should correspondingly use a `strict` or equivalent trust policy that enforces signature expiry. Together these steps enable use of up-to-date artifacts and safeguard against rollback attack in the event of registry compromise. The Notary Project offers various signature validation options such as `permissive`, `audit` and `skip` to support various scenarios. These scenarios includes 1) situations demanding urgent workload deployment, necessitating the bypassing of expired or revoked signatures; 2) auditing of artifacts lacking signatures without interrupting workload; and 3) skipping of verification for specific images that might have undergone validation through alternative mechanisms. Additionally, the Notary Project supports revocation to ensure the signature freshness. Artifact publishers can sign with short-lived certificates and revoke older certificates when necessary. This revocation serves as a signal to inform artifact consumers that the corresponding unexpired artifact is no longer approved by the publisher. This enables the artifact publisher to control the validity of the signature independently of their ability to manage artifacts in a compromised registry.|January 19, 2024; 6:15:07 PM -0500|V3.1: 6.8 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-23332&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23332

Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7.

CVE-2024-2338|PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a SQL injection vulnerability that allows a user who owns a table to elevate to superuser when dynamic masking is enabled. PostgreSQL Anonymizer enables users to set security labels on tables to mask specified columns. There is a flaw that allows complex expressions to be provided as a value. This expression is then later used as it to create the masked views leading to SQL Injection. If dynamic masking is enabled, this will lead to privilege escalation to superuser after the label is created. Users that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-23452|"Request smuggling vulnerability in HTTP server in Apache bRPC 0.9.5~1.7.0 on all platforms allows attacker to smuggle request.

Vulnerability Cause Description：

The http_parser does not comply with the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification.

Attack scenario:
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling or response splitting.
One particular attack scenario is that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the backend server. 

Solution:
You can choose one solution from below:
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0
 2.

CVE-2024-23633|"Label Studio, an open source data labeling tool had a remote import feature allowed users to import data from a remote web source, that was downloaded and could be viewed on the website. Prior to version 1.10.1, this feature could had been abused to download a HTML file that executed malicious JavaScript code in the context of the Label Studio website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.

`data_import/uploader.py` lines 125C5 through 146 showed that if a URL passed the server side request forgery verification checks, the contents of the file would be downloaded using the filename in the URL. The downloaded file path could then be retrieved by sending a request to `/api/projects/{project_id}/file-uploads?ids=[{download_id}]` where `{project_id}` was the ID of the project and `{download_id}` was the ID of the downloaded file. Once the downloaded file path was retrieved by the previous API endpoint, `data_import/api.py`lines 595C1 through 616C62 demonstrated that the `Content-Type` of the response was determined by the file extension, since `mimetypes.guess_type` guesses the `Content-Type` based on the file extension. Since the `Content-Type` was determined by the file extension of the downloaded file, an attacker could import in a `.html` file that would execute JavaScript when visited.

Version 1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other remediation strategies are also available. For all user provided files that are downloaded by Label Studio, set the `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;` response header when viewed on the site. The `sandbox` directive restricts a page's actions to prevent popups, execution of plugins and scripts and enforces a `same-origin` policy. Alternatively, restrict the allowed file extensions that may be downloaded."|January 23, 2024; 7:15:08 PM -0500|V3.1: 6.1 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-23633&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23633
CVE-2024-23634|GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file renaming vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API to rename arbitrary files and directories with a name that does not end in `.zip`. Store file uploads rename zip files to have a `.zip` extension if it doesn't already have one before unzipping the file.  This is fine for file and url upload methods where the files will be in a specific subdirectory of the data directory but, when using the external upload method, this allows arbitrary files and directories to be renamed. Renaming GeoServer files will most likely result in a denial of service, either completely preventing GeoServer from running or effectively deleting specific resources (such as a workspace, layer or style).  In some cases, renaming GeoServer files could revert to the default settings for that file which could be relatively harmless like removing contact information or have more serious consequences like allowing users to make OGC requests that the customized settings would have prevented them from making. The impact of renaming non-GeoServer files depends on the specific environment although some sort of denial of service is a likely outcome.

While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought.

CVE-2024-23644|"Trillium is a composable toolkit for building internet applications with async rust. In `trillium-http` prior to 0.3.12 and `trillium-client` prior to 0.5.4, insufficient validation of outbound header values may lead to request splitting or response splitting attacks in scenarios where attackers have sufficient control over headers. This only affects use cases where attackers have control of request headers, and can insert ""\r\n"" sequences. Specifically, if untrusted and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.

Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName` can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes when sending requests from the client or responses from the server. Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or names) in a request or response that they could inject `\r\n` sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses. (i.e. exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF, etc.)

In `trillium-http` versions 0.3.12 and later, if a header name is invalid in server response headers, the specific header and any associated values are omitted from network transmission. Additionally, if a header value is invalid in server response headers, the individual header value is omitted from network transmission. Other headers values with the same header name will still be sent. In `trillium-client` versions 0.5.4 and later, if any header name or header value is invalid in the client request headers, awaiting the client Conn returns an `Error::MalformedHeader` prior to any network access. As a workaround, Trillium services and client applications should sanitize or validate untrusted input that is included in header values and header names. Carriage return, newline, and null characters are not allowed."|January 24, 2024; 3:15:53 PM -0500|V3.1: 8.1 HIGHV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-23644&vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23644

CVE-2024-23649|"Lemmy is a link aggregator and forum for the fediverse. Starting in version 0.17.0 and prior to version 0.19.1, users can report private messages, even when they're neither sender nor recipient of the message. The API response to creating a private message report contains the private message itself, which means any user can just iterate over message ids to (loudly) obtain all private messages of an instance. A user with instance admin privileges can also abuse this if the private message is removed from the response, as they're able to see the resulting reports.

Creating a private message report by POSTing to `/api/v3/private_message/report` does not validate whether the reporter is the recipient of the message. lemmy-ui does not allow the sender to report the message; the API method should likely be restricted to accessible to recipients only. The API response when creating a report contains the `private_message_report_view` with all the details of the report, including the private message that has been reported:

Any authenticated user can obtain arbitrary (untargeted) private message contents. Privileges required depend on the instance configuration; when registrations are enabled without application system, the privileges required are practically none. When registration applications are required, privileges required could be considered low, but this assessment heavily varies by instance.

Version 0.19.1 contains a patch for this issue. A workaround is available. If an update to a fixed Lemmy version is not immediately possible, the API route can be blocked in the reverse proxy. This will prevent anyone from reporting private messages, but it will also prevent exploitation before the update has been applied."|January 24, 2024; 1:15:09 PM -0500|V3.1: 6.5 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-23649&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23649

CVE-2024-23944|"Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.

CVE-2024-24563|"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Arrays can be keyed by a signed integer, while they are defined for unsigned integers only. The typechecker doesn't throw when spotting the usage of an `int` as an index for an array. The typechecker allows the usage of signed integers to be used as indexes to arrays. The vulnerability is present in different forms in all versions, including `0.3.10`. For ints, the 2's complement representation is used. Because the array was declared very large, the bounds checking will pass Negative values will simply be represented as very large numbers. As of time of publication, a fixed version does not exist.

There are three potential vulnerability classes: unpredictable behavior, accessing inaccessible elements and denial of service. Class 1: If it is possible to index an array with a negative integer without reverting, this is most likely not anticipated by the developer and such accesses can cause unpredictable behavior for the contract. Class 2: If a contract has an invariant in the form `assert index < x`, the developer will suppose that no elements on indexes `y | y >= x` are accessible. However, by using negative indexes, this can be bypassed. Class 3: If the index is dependent on the state of the contract, this poses a risk of denial of service. If the state of the contract can be manipulated in such way that the index will be forced to be negative, the array access can always revert (because most likely the array won't be declared extremely large). However, all these the scenarios are highly unlikely. Most likely behavior is a revert on the bounds check."|February 07, 2024; 12:15:10 PM -0500|V3.1: 9.8 CRITICALV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-24563&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24563

CVE-2024-24771|Open Forms allows users create and publish smart forms. Versions prior to 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain a non-exploitable multi-factor authentication weakness. Superusers who have their credentials (username + password) compromised could potentially have the second-factor authentication bypassed if an attacker somehow managed to authenticate to Open Forms. The maintainers of Open Forms do not believe it is or has been possible to perform this login. However, if this were possible, the victim's account may be abused to view (potentially sensitive) submission data or have been used to impersonate other staff accounts to view and/or modify data. Three mitigating factors to help prevent exploitation include: the usual login page (at `/admin/login/`) does not fully log in the user until the second factor was succesfully provided; the additional non-MFA protected login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` was misconfigured and could not be used to log in; and there are no additional ways to log in. This also requires credentials of a superuser to be compromised to be exploitable. Versions 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain the following patches to address these weaknesses: Move and only enable the API auth endpoints (`/api/v2/api-auth/login/`) with `settings.DEBUG = True`. `settings.DEBUG = True` is insecure and should never be applied in production settings. Additionally, apply a custom permission check to the hijack flow to only allow second-factor-verified superusers to perform user hijacking.|February 07, 2024; 10:15:08 AM -0500|V3.1: 5.9 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-24771&vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24771

CVE-2024-24806|libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.

CVE-2024-24814|mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2.

CVE-2024-24823|Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id, even if for different user credentials. In this case, the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session, provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high, because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser, potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, and any versions of the 6.0 development branch, contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists, but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint, as that is the only one vulnerable.|February 07, 2024; 1:15:54 PM -0500|V3.1: 4.4 MEDIUMV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2024-24823&vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24823

Graylog's cluster config system uses fully qualified class names as config keys. To validate the existence of the requested class before using them, Graylog loads the class using the class loader. If a user with the appropriate permissions performs the request, arbitrary classes with 1-arg String constructors can be instantiated. This will execute arbitrary code that is run during class instantiation.

CVE-2024-24828|pkg is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21’s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team.

CVE-2024-25106|"OpenObserve is a observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, designed to work at petabyte scale. A critical vulnerability has been identified in the ""/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}"" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles. This includes the ability to remove users with ""Admin"" and ""Root"" roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to remove members from their organization. The function does not check if the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization, irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can remove critical users, including ""Admins"" and ""Root"" users. This could result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or operational disruptions. Given that user accounts are typically created by ""Admins"" or ""Root"" users, this vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has been granted access to an organization, thereby posing a critical risk to the security and operational stability of the application.

CVE-2024-25117|php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.2, php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`), or the `Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused.

CVE-2024-25129|The CodeQL CLI repo holds binaries for the CodeQL command line interface (CLI). Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.|February 22, 2024; 2:15:08 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25129

CVE-2024-25617|Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-25618|Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS, SAML, OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time, Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However, using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account, the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium, as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However, some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover, OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.|February 14, 2024; 4:15:08 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25618
CVE-2024-25619|"Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed, the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed, this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens, it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration, which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire, since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate, we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being ""killed"". Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18.

Prior to versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19, when fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the attacker to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as the ActivityPub actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type.

CVE-2024-25625|Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController, specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint, resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact, if a host header is injected in the POST request, the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.|February 19, 2024; 11:15:52 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25625

CVE-2024-25636|Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type.

CVE-2024-26138|"The XWiki licensor application, which manages and enforce application licenses for paid extensions, includes the document `Licenses.Code.LicenseJSON` that provides information for admins regarding active licenses. This document is public and thus exposes this information publicly. The information includes the instance's id as well as first and last name and email of the license owner. This is a leak of information that isn't supposed to be public. The instance id allows associating data on the active installs data with the concrete XWiki instance. Active installs assures that ""there's no way to find who's having a given UUID"" (referring to the instance id). Further, the information who the license owner is and information about the obtained licenses can be used for targeted phishing attacks. Also, while user information is normally public, email addresses might only be displayed obfuscated,  depending on the configuration. This has been fixed in Application Licensing 1.24.2. There are no known workarounds besides upgrading."|February 21, 2024; 12:15:10 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26138

CVE-2024-26147|Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.|February 21, 2024; 6:15:08 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26147

 -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when

CVE-2024-26586|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

CVE-2024-26589|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

  func#0 @0
  0: R1=ctx() R10=fp0
  0: (bf) r6 = r1                       ; R1=ctx() R6_w=ctx()

This prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8
to r7, and finally causes out-of-bounds access:

CVE-2024-26596|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: fix netdev_priv() dereference before check on non-DSA netdevice events

After the blamed commit, we started doing this dereference for every
NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER and NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event in the system.

static inline struct dsa_port *dsa_user_to_port(const struct net_device *dev)
{
	struct dsa_user_priv *p = netdev_priv(dev);

	return p->dp;
}

Which is obviously bogus, because not all net_devices have a netdev_priv()
of type struct dsa_user_priv. But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small,
and p->dp means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most
drivers allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not
fault, and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't
caught.

But the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls
alloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv() dereference
is invalid, and we get this when we emit a NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event
with a VLAN as its new upper:

$ ip link add dummy1 type dummy
$ ip link add link dummy1 name dummy1.100 type vlan id 100

x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer

Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed
from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:

 * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
   fx_sw->xfeatures.
 * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of
   the buffer required by xrstor is accessible.

In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and
tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.

Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken
from fpstate->user_size).

CVE-2024-26606|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: signal epoll threads of self-work

In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.

It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work."|February 26, 2024; 11:28:00 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26606

The issue here is as follows:

- tidss probes, but is deferred as sii902x is still missing.
- sii902x starts probing and enters sii902x_init().
- sii902x calls drm_bridge_add(). Now the sii902x bridge is ready from
  DRM's perspective.
- sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() and
  platform_device_register_data()
- The registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the
  deferred devices.
- tidss probes, which eventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be
  called.
- sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid.
  However, the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading
  to the crash.

Fix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the
sii902x_init(), which is also at the very end of sii902x_probe()."|February 29, 2024; 7:15:47 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26607

It is possible that the connection is in process of being established
when we dump it. Assumed that the connection has been registered in a
link group by smc_conn_create() but the rmb_desc has not yet been
initialized by smc_buf_create(), thus causing the illegal access to
conn->rmb_desc. So fix it by checking before dump."|March 11, 2024; 2:15:19 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26615

- Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free

[CAUSE]
The converted fs has the following data chunk layout:

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single

For above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end
(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).

This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio
function for both of the two halves.

However scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function
to be called once, not any more.
This means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,
leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to
use-after-free.

[FIX]
- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range
  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not
  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.

- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range
  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to
  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.

Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:

- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()
  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,
  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read
  beyond the chunk."|March 11, 2024; 2:15:19 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26616

CVE-2024-26620|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix

The vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter or
domain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to update
the guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and
domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only
the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new
domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to
the vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's
matrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.

Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will
result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the
vfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:

guest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):
14.0004
14.0005
14.0006
16.0004
16.0005
16.0006

unassign domain 4
unbind queue 16.0005
assign domain 4

When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the
APQNs that will be examined will be:
14.0004
16.0004

Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the
vfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix
when updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005
will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This
violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be
given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their
pass-through.

To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will
be inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix."|March 11, 2024; 2:15:19 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26620

CVE-2024-26623|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: Prevent race issues involving the adminq

There are multiple paths that can result in using the pdsc's
adminq.

[1] pdsc_adminq_isr and the resulting work from queue_work(),
    i.e. pdsc_work_thread()->pdsc_process_adminq()

[2] pdsc_adminq_post()

When the device goes through reset via PCIe reset and/or
a fw_down/fw_up cycle due to bad PCIe state or bad device
state the adminq is destroyed and recreated.

A NULL pointer dereference can happen if [1] or [2] happens
after the adminq is already destroyed.

In order to fix this, add some further state checks and
implement reference counting for adminq uses. Reference
counting was used because multiple threads can attempt to
access the adminq at the same time via [1] or [2]. Additionally,
multiple clients (i.e. pds-vfio-pci) can be using [2]
at the same time.

The adminq_refcnt is initialized to 1 when the adminq has been
allocated and is ready to use. Users/clients of the adminq
(i.e. [1] and [2]) will increment the refcnt when they are using
the adminq. When the driver goes into a fw_down cycle it will
set the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD bit and then wait for the adminq_refcnt
to hit 1. Setting the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD before waiting will prevent
any further adminq_refcnt increments. Waiting for the
adminq_refcnt to hit 1 allows for any current users of the adminq
to finish before the driver frees the adminq. Once the
adminq_refcnt hits 1 the driver clears the refcnt to signify that
the adminq is deleted and cannot be used. On the fw_up cycle the
driver will once again initialize the adminq_refcnt to 1 allowing
the adminq to be used again."|March 06, 2024; 2:15:12 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26623

CVE-2024-26627|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler

Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host
lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.

This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:

 - N hardware queues

 - queue depth is M for each hardware queue

 - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests

If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called
for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -
1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.

If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring
host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).

Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't
need the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never
covers that.

CVE-2024-26629|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER

The test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and
harmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.

First: harmful.
As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
incorrect behaviour.

If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
incorrect error.

The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
some later locking request.

When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.

So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
so_count allows.

The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.

so_count is the sum of three different counts.
1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.

When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
clear what the other one is expected to be.

In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.

In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.

The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.

So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather
than testing so_count against the mysterious '2'."|March 13, 2024; 10:15:07 AM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26629

mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk

In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute
its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However, we
do not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,
which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another
folio/page/slab.

Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for
the folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.

This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their
dirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow
conventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get ""cleaned"" during
swapout, after which they're no longer resident etc."|March 13, 2024; 12:15:30 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26630

llc_conn_handler() initialises local variables {saddr,daddr}.mac
based on skb in llc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes
them to __llc_lookup().

However, the initialisation is done only when skb->protocol is
htons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise, __llc_lookup_established() and
__llc_lookup_listener() will read garbage.

The missing initialisation existed prior to commit 211ed865108e

It removed the part to kick out the token ring stuff but forgot to
close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneak into llc_rcv().

CVE-2024-26636|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes

syzbot was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1]

Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb().
Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all the sanity checks
that were performed.

This fix:

- Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space.
- Check all conditions again after socket lock is held again.
- Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.

CVE-2024-26639|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section

Alexander Potapenko writes in [1]: ""For every memory access in the code
instrumented by KMSAN we call kmsan_get_metadata() to obtain the metadata
for the memory being accessed.  For virtual memory the metadata pointers
are stored in the corresponding `struct page`, therefore we need to call
virt_to_page() to get them.

According to the comment in arch/x86/include/asm/page.h,
virt_to_page(kaddr) returns a valid pointer iff virt_addr_valid(kaddr) is
true, so KMSAN needs to call virt_addr_valid() as well.

To avoid recursion, kmsan_get_metadata() must not call instrumented code,
therefore ./arch/x86/include/asm/kmsan.h forks parts of
arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c to check whether a virtual address is valid or not.

But the introduction of rcu_read_lock() to pfn_valid() added instrumented
RCU API calls to virt_to_page_or_null(), which is called by
kmsan_get_metadata(), so there is an infinite recursion now.  I do not
think it is correct to stop that recursion by doing
kmsan_enter_runtime()/kmsan_exit_runtime() in kmsan_get_metadata(): that
would prevent instrumented functions called from within the runtime from
tracking the shadow values, which might introduce false positives.""

Fix the issue by switching pfn_valid() to the _sched() variant of
rcu_read_lock/unlock(), which does not require calling into RCU.  Given
the critical section in pfn_valid() is very small, this is a reasonable
trade-off (with preemptible RCU).

KMSAN further needs to be careful to suppress calls into the scheduler,
which would be another source of recursion.  This can be done by wrapping
the call to pfn_valid() into preempt_disable/enable_no_resched().  The
downside is that this sacrifices breaking scheduling guarantees; however,
a kernel compiled with KMSAN has already given up any performance
guarantees due to being heavily instrumented.

Note, KMSAN code already disables tracing via Makefile, and since mmzone.h
is included, it is not necessary to use the notrace variant, which is
generally preferred in all other cases."|March 18, 2024; 7:15:10 AM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26639

tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy

TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map pages initially allocated
from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs.

This patch adds to can_map_frag() these additional checks:

- Page must not be a compound one.
- page->mapping must be NULL.

This fixes the panic reported by ZhangPeng.

syzbot was able to loopback packets built with sendfile(),
mapping pages owned by an ext4 file to TCP rx zerocopy.

CVE-2024-26646|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PMThe kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to thehardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occursduring boot and remains constant throughout runtime.When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a secondmemory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location aspart of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer maydiffer from the one allocated by the image kernel.When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFIbuffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if thehardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from therestore kernel).It is also possible that the hardware ""forgets"" the address of the memorybuffer when resuming from ""deep"" suspend. Memory corruption may also occurin such a scenario.To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing tosuspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages ofnon-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on theboot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during ""deep"" suspendand hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.[ rjw: Comment adjustment, subject and changelog edits ]"|March 26, 2024; 2:15:09 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26650|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probep2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. Itguards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallelrescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlockwhen PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescanlocks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devicescall p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.Hence the deadlock.To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),refer the cache and return to the caller.Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, checkthat its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCHspecifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devicesat the same DEVFN.Tested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>|March 26, 2024; 2:15:10 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

Inthis case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later.

If a bhash bucket exists for the port, wecall __inet_check_established() or __inet6_check_established() to checkif the bucket is reusable.If reusable, we add the socket into ehash and set inet_sk(sk)->inet_num.Later, we look up the corresponding bhash2 bucket and try to allocateit if it does not exist.Although it rarely occurs in real use, if the allocation fails, we mustrevert the changes by check_established().  Otherwise, an unconnectedsocket could illegally occupy an ehash entry.Note that we do not put tw back into ehash because sk might havealready responded to a packet for tw and it would be better to freetw earlier under such memory presure.[0]:WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 350830 at net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193 inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193)Modules linked in:Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193)Code: 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e e9 2d 4a 3d fd e8 28 4a 3d fd 48 89 ef e8 f0 cd 7d ff 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e e9 13 4a 3d fd e8 0e 4a 3d fd <0f> 0b e9 61 fe ff ff e8 02 4a 3d fd 4c 89 e7 be 03 00 00 00 e8 05RSP: 0018:ffffc9000b21fd38 EFLAGS: 00010293RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000009e78 RCX: ffffffff840bae40RDX: ffff88806e46c600 RSI: ffffffff840bb012 RDI: ffff88811755cca8RBP: ffff88811755c880 R08: 0000000000000003 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000009e78 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff88811755c8e0R13: ffff88811755c892 R14: ffff88811755c918 R15: 0000000000000000FS:  00007f03e5243800(0000) GS:ffff88811ae00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 0000001b32f21000 CR3: 0000000112ffe001 CR4: 0000000000770ef0PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> ? inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193) dccp_close (net/dccp/proto.c:1078) inet_release (net/ipv4/af_inet.c:434) __sock_release (net/socket.c:660) sock_close (net/socket.c:1423) __fput (fs/file_table.c:377) __fput_sync (fs/file_table.c:462) __x64_sys_close (fs/open.c:1557 fs/open.c:1539 fs/open.c:1539) do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)RIP: 0033:0x7f03e53852bbCode: 03 00 00 00 0f 05 48 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 41 c3 48 83 ec 18 89 7c 24 0c e8 43 c9 f5 ff 8b 7c 24 0c 41 89 c0 b8 03 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 35 44 89 c7 89 44 24 0c e8 a1 c9 f5 ff 8b 44RSP: 002b:00000000005dfba0 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000003RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000004 RCX: 00007f03e53852bbRDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000003RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 000000000000167cR10: 0000000008a79680 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 00007f03e4e43000R13: 00007f03e4e43170 R14: 00007f03e4e43178 R15: 00007f03e4e43170 </TASK>[1]:FAULT_INJECTION: forcing a failure.name failslab, interval 1, probability 0, space 0, times 0CPU: 0 PID: 350833 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 6.7.0-12272-g2121c43f88f5 #9Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1)) should_fail_ex (lib/fault-inject.c:52 lib/fault-inject.c:153) should_failslab (mm/slub.c:3748) kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3763 mm/slub.c:3842 mm/slub.c:3867) inet_bind2_bucket_create ---truncated---|April 03, 2024; 1:15:51 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,fixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.When TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMUtables.iommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers ""ibm,dma-window"" propertywhen initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs aredynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is notinitialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for theSR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().The fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in theFDT. There are 2 points to remember:	1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both	   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to	   initialize the IOMMU table.	2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would	   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as	   ""dynamic"". This works fine since, at the time of table	   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the	   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for	   kdump to succeed."|April 04, 2024; 5:15:07 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26759|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcacheWhen skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threadsswapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). Before one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to thePTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free theentry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. It breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,causing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into thePTE and cause data corruption.One possible callstack is like this:CPU0                                 CPU1----                                 ----do_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path><alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>swap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>...                                  set_pte_at()                                     swap_free() <- entry is free                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>pte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems              unchanged, but page A              is stalled!swap_free() <- page B content lost!set_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!And besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard theentry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()on CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause dataloss.To fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry usingthe cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent anyparallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin afterPT unlocked.Racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  Aschedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated pagefaults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise toperf statistics.

The HDM decoderstops working which causes system memory being disabled and further asystem hang during HDM decoder initialization, typically when a CXLenabled kernel boots.Prevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if thedecoder's CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.Note the change only fixes a hardware hang, but does not implementHPA/SPA translation.

CVE-2024-26768|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:LoongArch: Change acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] to acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]With default config, the value of NR_CPUS is 64. When HW platform hasmore then 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PICis the maximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which canexceed the supported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number),but kernel should not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, letthe remainder cpus stay in BIOS.The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] canbe overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PICshould be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so itis better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,otherwise system will crash with the following message.[    0.000000] CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000420000004259, era == 90000000037a5f0c, ra == 90000000037a46ec[    0.000000] Oops[#1]:[    0.000000] CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.8.0-rc2+ #192[    0.000000] Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown 2/2/2022[    0.000000] pc 90000000037a5f0c ra 90000000037a46ec tp 9000000003c90000 sp 9000000003c93d60[    0.000000] a0 0000000000000019 a1 9000000003d93bc0 a2 0000000000000000 a3 9000000003c93bd8[    0.000000] a4 9000000003c93a74 a5 9000000083c93a67 a6 9000000003c938f0 a7 0000000000000005[    0.000000] t0 0000420000004201 t1 0000000000000000 t2 0000000000000001 t3 0000000000000001[    0.000000] t4 0000000000000003 t5 0000000000000000 t6 0000000000000030 t7 0000000000000063[    0.000000] t8 0000000000000014 u0 ffffffffffffffff s9 0000000000000000 s0 9000000003caee98[    0.000000] s1 90000000041b0480 s2 9000000003c93da0 s3 9000000003c93d98 s4 9000000003c93d90[    0.000000] s5 9000000003caa000 s6 000000000a7fd000 s7 000000000f556b60 s8 000000000e0a4330[    0.000000]    ra: 90000000037a46ec platform_init+0x214/0x250[    0.000000]   ERA: 90000000037a5f0c efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94[    0.000000]  CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)[    0.000000]  PRMD: 00000000 (PPLV0 -PIE -PWE)[    0.000000]  EUEN: 00000000 (-FPE -SXE -ASXE -BTE)[    0.000000]  ECFG: 00070800 (LIE=11 VS=7)[    0.000000] ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)[    0.000000]  BADV: 0000420000004259[    0.000000]  PRID: 0014c010 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3A5000)[    0.000000] Modules linked in:[    0.000000] Process swapper (pid: 0, threadinfo=(____ptrval____), task=(____ptrval____))[    0.000000] Stack : 9000000003c93a14 9000000003800898 90000000041844f8 90000000037a46ec[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 0000000008290000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000019d8000 000000000f556b60[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08 9000000003ca7700 9000000003800000[    0.000000]         9000000003c93e50 9000000003800898 9000000003800108 90000000037a484c[    0.000000]         000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08[    0.000000]         9000000003ca7700 9000000004184000 0000000000200000 000000000e02b018[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 90000000037a0790 9000000003800108 0000000000000000[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000[    0.000000]         000000000f556b08 000000000eaae298 000000000eaa5040 0000000000200000[    0.000000]         ...[    0.000000] Call Trace:[    0.000000] [<90000000037a5f0c>] efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94[    0.000000] [<90000000037a46ec>] platform_init+0x214/0x250[    0.000000] [<90000000037a484c>] setup_arch+0x124/0x45c[    0.000000] [<90000000037a0790>] start_kernel+0x90/0x670[    0.000000] [<900000000378b0d8>] kernel_entry+0xd8/0xdc|April 03, 2024; 1:15:52 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26792|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot creation failureWhen creating a snapshot we may do a double free of an anonymous devicein case there's an error committing the transaction. The second free mayresult in freeing an anonymous device number that was allocated by someother subsystem in the kernel or another btrfs filesystem.The steps that lead to this:1) At ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we allocate an anonymous device number   and assign it to pending_snapshot->anon_dev;2) Then we call btrfs_commit_transaction() and end up at   transaction.c:create_pending_snapshot();3) There we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root() and pass it the anonymous device   number stored in pending_snapshot->anon_dev;4) btrfs_get_new_fs_root() frees that anonymous device number because   btrfs_lookup_fs_root() returned a root - someone else did a lookup   of the new root already, which could some task doing backref walking;5) After that some error happens in the transaction commit path, and at   ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we jump to the 'fail' label, and after   that we free again the same anonymous device number, which in the   meanwhile may have been reallocated somewhere else, because   pending_snapshot->anon_dev still has the same value as in step 1.Recently syzbot ran into this and reported the following trace:  ------------[ cut here ]------------  ida_free called for id=51 which is not allocated.

CVE-2024-26794|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemapFor fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for thewhole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in ascenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range ofthe same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice butit may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration ofthe fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens likethis:1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item   in the leaf currently being processed;2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers   the warning:      if (cache->offset + cache->len > offset) {               WARN_ON(1);               return -EINVAL;      }   Since we get 1M > 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack   trace like the following:     [1621.677651] ------------[ cut here ]------------     [1621.677656] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 204366 at fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2492 emit_fiemap_extent+0x84/0x90 [btrfs]     [1621.677899] Modules linked in: btrfs blake2b_generic (...)

CVE-2024-26802|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:stmmac: Clear variable when destroying workqueueCurrently when suspending driver and stopping workqueue it is checked whetherworkqueue is not NULL and if so, it is destroyed.Function destroy_workqueue() does drain queue and does clear variable, butit does not set workqueue variable to NULL. This can cause kernel/modulepanic if code attempts to clear workqueue that was not initialized.This scenario is possible when resuming suspended driver in stmmac_resume(),because there is no handling for failed stmmac_hw_setup(),which can fail and return if DMA engine has failed to initialize,and workqueue is initialized after DMA engine.Should DMA engine fail to initialize, resume will proceed normally,but interface won't work and TX queue will eventually timeout,causing 'Reset adapter' error.This then does destroy workqueue during reset process.And since workqueue is initialized after DMA engine and can be skipped,it will cause kernel/module panic.To secure against this possible crash, set workqueue variable to NULL whendestroying workqueue.Log/backtrace from crash goes as follows:[88.031977]------------[ cut here ]------------[88.031985]NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0 (sxgmac): transmit queue 1 timed out[88.032017]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at net/sched/sch_generic.c:477 dev_watchdog+0x390/0x398           <Skipping backtrace for watchdog timeout>[88.032251]---[ end trace e70de432e4d5c2c0 ]---[88.032282]sxgmac 16d88000.ethernet eth0: Reset adapter.[88.036359]------------[ cut here ]------------[88.036519]Call trace:[88.036523] flush_workqueue+0x3e4/0x430[88.036528] drain_workqueue+0xc4/0x160[88.036533] destroy_workqueue+0x40/0x270[88.036537] stmmac_fpe_stop_wq+0x4c/0x70[88.036541] stmmac_release+0x278/0x280[88.036546] __dev_close_many+0xcc/0x158[88.036551] dev_close_many+0xbc/0x190[88.036555] dev_close.part.0+0x70/0xc0[88.036560] dev_close+0x24/0x30[88.036564] stmmac_service_task+0x110/0x140[88.036569] process_one_work+0x1d8/0x4a0[88.036573] worker_thread+0x54/0x408[88.036578] kthread+0x164/0x170[88.036583] ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20[88.036588]---[ end trace e70de432e4d5c2c1 ]---[88.036597]Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000004|April 04, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26803|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: veth: clear GRO when clearing XDP even when downveth sets NETIF_F_GRO automatically when XDP is enabled,because both features use the same NAPI machinery.The logic to clear NETIF_F_GRO sits in veth_disable_xdp() whichis called both on ndo_stop and when XDP is turned off.To avoid the flag from being cleared when the device is broughtdown, the clearing is skipped when IFF_UP is not set.Bringing the device down should indeed not modify its features.Unfortunately, this means that clearing is also skipped whenXDP is disabled _while_ the device is down. And there's nothingon the open path to bring the device features back into sync.IOW if user enables XDP, disables it and then brings the deviceup we'll end up with a stray GRO flag set but no NAPI instances.We don't depend on the GRO flag on the datapath, so the datapathwon't crash. We will crash (or hang), however, next time featuresare sync'ed (either by user via ethtool or peer changing its config).The GRO flag will go away, and veth will try to disable the NAPIs.But the open path never created them since XDP was off, the GRO flagwas a stray. If NAPI was initialized before we'll hang in napi_disable().If it never was we'll crash trying to stop uninitialized hrtimer.Move the GRO flag updates to the XDP enable / disable paths,instead of mixing them with the ndo_open / ndo_close paths.|April 04, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

IOW, we skb->data gets ""adjusted"" by a huge value.The negative value is returned because skb->head and skb->data distance ismore than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) has wrapped around.The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can causedev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.The syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gretunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)tunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.This results in the following pattern:1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.Route lookup found an output device, ipip0.2).ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0->needed_headroom based on the futureoutput device, rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0).3).ip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the samecode path again (xmit recursion).4).Routing step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output deviceto use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.tunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)gre0 device headroom.This repeats for every future packet:gre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 stepincremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0needed_headroom was increased.For each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows untilpost-expand-head reallocations result in a skb->head/data distance ofmore than 64k.Once that happens, skb->network_header (u16) wraps around whenpskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchangedafter the headroom expansion/reallocation.After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)result post headroom expansion.The next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull thenetwork header) makes skb->data point to a memory location outsideskb->head area.v2: Cap the needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit toprevent perpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom incrementcompletely."|April 04, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

Since the tailroom is notinitialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitializedmemory area when copying the data.This patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb->end` to`skb->len`, which is the actual data offset.BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186 instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline] copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline] iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline] iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline] iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline] _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186 copy_to_iter include/linux/uio.h:197 [inline] simple_copy_to_iter+0x68/0xa0 net/core/datagram.c:532 __skb_datagram_iter+0x123/0xdc0 net/core/datagram.c:420 skb_copy_datagram_iter+0x5c/0x200 net/core/datagram.c:546 skb_copy_datagram_msg include/linux/skbuff.h:3960 [inline] packet_recvmsg+0xd9c/0x2000 net/packet/af_packet.c:3482 sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1044 [inline] sock_recvmsg net/socket.c:1066 [inline] sock_read_iter+0x467/0x580 net/socket.c:1136 call_read_iter include/linux/fs.h:2014 [inline] new_sync_read fs/read_write.c:389 [inline] vfs_read+0x8f6/0xe00 fs/read_write.c:470 ksys_read+0x20f/0x4c0 fs/read_write.c:613 __do_sys_read fs/read_write.c:623 [inline] __se_sys_read fs/read_write.c:621 [inline] __x64_sys_read+0x93/0xd0 fs/read_write.c:621 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6bUninit was stored to memory at: skb_put_data include/linux/skbuff.h:2622 [inline] netlink_to_full_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:181 [inline] __netlink_deliver_tap_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:298 [inline] __netlink_deliver_tap+0x5be/0xc90 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:325 netlink_deliver_tap net/netlink/af_netlink.c:338 [inline] netlink_deliver_tap_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:347 [inline] netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1341 [inline] netlink_unicast+0x10f1/0x1250 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1368 netlink_sendmsg+0x1238/0x13d0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1910 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline] ____sys_sendmsg+0x9c2/0xd60 net/socket.c:2584 ___sys_sendmsg+0x28d/0x3c0 net/socket.c:2638 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2667 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2676 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2674 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x307/0x490 net/socket.c:2674 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6bUninit was created at: free_pages_prepare mm/page_alloc.c:1087 [inline] free_unref_page_prepare+0xb0/0xa40 mm/page_alloc.c:2347 free_unref_page_list+0xeb/0x1100 mm/page_alloc.c:2533 release_pages+0x23d3/0x2410 mm/swap.c:1042 free_pages_and_swap_cache+0xd9/0xf0 mm/swap_state.c:316 tlb_batch_pages---truncated---|April 04, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26806|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooksThe ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are notexpected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.Those helpers have two roles currently: - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker. - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag.

CVE-2024-26812|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handlerA vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can bedeconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allowseventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctlor through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igatemutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupthandler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd pathruns asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from theatomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfdrelative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible withexisting userspace.As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of theINTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context objectand irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particulartrigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path andeventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can bedynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.|April 05, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26813|In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlersThe vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering ofan interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user,which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.Rather than register the IRQ relative to a valid trigger, register allIRQs in a disabled state in the device open path.  This allows maskoperations on the IRQ to nest within the overall enable state governedby a valid eventfd signal.  This decouples @masked, protected by the@locked spinlock from @trigger, protected via the @igate mutex.In doing so, it's guaranteed that changes to @trigger cannot race theIRQ handlers because the IRQ handler is synchronously disabled beforemodifying the trigger, and loopback triggering of the IRQ via ioctl issafe due to serialization with trigger changes via igate.For compatibility, request_irq() failures are maintained to be local tothe SET_IRQS ioctl rather than a fatal error in the open device path.This allows, for example, a userspace driver with polling mode supportto continue to work regardless of moving the request_irq() call site.This necessarily blocks all SET_IRQS access to the failed index.|April 05, 2024; 5:15:09 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

It's not sufficient to assumethe bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridgepasses the D0 test, but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and configspace of the polled device becomes inaccessible during pci_pme_wakeup().Therefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be in theRPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage countto maintain the state while polling the subordinate device.This resolves a regression reported in the bugzilla below where aThunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpointdownstream of a bridge in a D3hot power state.|April 17, 2024; 12:15:08 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-26921|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:inet: inet_defrag: prevent sk release while still in useip_local_out() and other functions can pass skb->sk as function argument.If the skb is a fragment and reassembly happens before such function callreturns, the sk must not be released.This affects skb fragments reassembled via netfilter or similarmodules, e.g. openvswitch or ct_act.c, when run as part of tx pipeline.Eric Dumazet made an initial analysis of this bug.  Quoting Eric:  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),  which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing.  A relevant old patch about the issue was :  8282f27449bf (""inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()"")  [..]  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb->sk being set, and probably to an  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ  packet scheduler will not work properly.  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.Eric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.However there is a problem with this:If skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copyhead->sk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.IOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect thefully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.This change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.As ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff->sk member, we must move theoffset into the FRAG_CB, else skb->sk gets clobbered.This allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb hasto be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.In the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This issafe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.In the latter case, we will steal the skb->sk reference, reattach it tothe head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize."|April 18, 2024; 6:15:07 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

Additionally, Zulip did not remove view permissions on the message from recently-active users, allowing the message to show up in the ""All messages"" view or in search results, but not in ""Inbox"" or ""Recent conversations"" views. While the bug has been present since moving messages between streams was first introduced in version 3.0, this option became much more common starting in Zulip 8.0, when the default option in the picker for moving the very last message in a conversation was changed.

CVE-2024-27301|"Support App is an opensource application specialized in managing Apple devices. It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang `#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it'll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file  `$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed.
An attacker could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."|March 14, 2024; 3:15:50 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27301
CVE-2024-27302|go-zero is a web and rpc framework. Go-zero allows user to specify a CORS Filter with a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy. However, the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass via a malicious domain. This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing any page to make requests and/or retrieve data on behalf of other users.

CVE-2024-27303|electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron, Proton Native app for macOS, Windows and Linux. A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in Windows, the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer, the installer will run the malicious file. Version 24.13.2 fixes this issue. No known workaround exists. The code executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system, so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.|March 06, 2024; 2:15:08 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27303

CVE-2024-27308|Mio is a Metal I/O library for Rust. When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free. For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific, and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11. All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0 will ignore invalid tokens, so they are not vulnerable. Vulnerable libraries that use mio can work around this issue by detecting and ignoring invalid tokens.|March 06, 2024; 3:15:47 PM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27308
CVE-2024-27309|While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.|April 12, 2024; 3:15:08 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-27894|"The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function's implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include ""file"", ""http"", and ""https"". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.
This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with ""functionsWorkerEnabled=true"".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 

2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.
3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.
3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.
3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: ""additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns"" and ""additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns"". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation."|March 12, 2024; 3:15:47 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27894

CVE-2024-27918|"Coder allows oragnizations to provision remote development environments via Terraform. Prior to versions 2.6.1, 2.7.3, and 2.8.4, a vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow an attacker to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an account with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only affected if the OIDC provider allows users to create accounts on the provider. During OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly validated against the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could allow a user with a domain that only partially matched an allowed domain to successfully login or register. An attacker could register a domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a Coder instance with a public OIDC provider.

Coder instances with OIDC enabled and protected by the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration are affected. Coder instances using a private OIDC provider are not affected, as arbitrary users cannot register through a private OIDC provider without first having an account on the provider. Public OIDC providers are impacted. GitHub authentication and external authentication are not impacted. This vulnerability is remedied in versions 2.8.4, 2.7.3, and 2.6.1 All versions prior to these patches are affected by the vulnerability.*It is recommended that customers upgrade their deployments as soon as possible if they are utilizing OIDC authentication with the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` setting."|March 20, 2024; 10:52:20 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27918

CVE-2024-27933|"Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.

This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.

Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior.

CVE-2024-28175|Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim's permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD.|March 13, 2024; 5:16:00 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28175

CVE-2024-28181| turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2.

CVE-2024-28186|"FreeScout is an open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP.

A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124.

Attackers can use this to execute CSRF attacks on victims, allowing them to retrieve, modify or delete data on the affected YourSpotify instance. Using repeated CSRF attacks, it is also possible to create a new user on the victim instance and promote the new user to instance administrator if a legitimate administrator visits a website prepared by an attacker. Note: Real-world exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the browser version and browser settings in use by the victim. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-28196|your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account, resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-28197|Zitadel is an open source identity management system. Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.  Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`.|March 11, 2024; 4:15:07 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28197

CVE-2024-28231|eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate.

CVE-2024-28236|"Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the ""no commands"" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the ""no commands"" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature."|March 12, 2024; 5:15:59 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28236

CVE-2024-28251|Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.|March 13, 2024; 8:15:33 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28251
CVE-2024-28252|CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.|March 15, 2024; 3:15:07 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28252
CVE-2024-28253|OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.|March 15, 2024; 4:15:09 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28253
CVE-2024-28254|OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `‎AlertUtil::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default uses the `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and, therefore, any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.|March 15, 2024; 4:15:10 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28254
CVE-2024-28255|OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.|March 15, 2024; 4:15:10 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28255

CVE-2024-28847|OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. Similarly to the GHSL-2023-250 issue, `AlertUtil::validateExpression` is also called from `EventSubscriptionRepository.prepare()`, which can lead to Remote Code Execution. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that, even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and, therefore, after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/events/subscriptions` which gets handled by `EventSubscriptionResource.createOrUpdateEventSubscription()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-28848|OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `‎CompiledRule::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using an `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution.

Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-28864|SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.|March 18, 2024; 6:15:09 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28864

CVE-2024-29018|"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace."|March 20, 2024; 5:15:31 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29018

CVE-2024-29037|datahub-helm provides the Kubernetes Helm charts for deploying Datahub and its dependencies on a Kubernetes cluster. Starting in version 0.1.143 and prior to version 0.2.182, due to configuration issues in the helm chart, if there was a successful initial deployment during a limited window of time, personal access tokens were possibly created with a default secret key. Since the secret key is a static, publicly available value, someone could inspect the algorithm used to generate personal access tokens and generate their own for an instance. Deploying with Metadata Service Authentication enabled would have been difficult during window of releases. If someone circumvented the helm settings and manually set Metadata Service Authentication to be enabled using environment variables directly, this would skip over the autogeneration logic for the Kubernetes Secrets and DataHub GMS would default to the signing key specified statically in the application.yml. Most deployments probably did not attempt to circumvent the helm settings to enable Metadata Service Authentication during this time, so impact is most likely limited. Any deployments with Metadata Service Authentication enabled should ensure that their secret values are properly randomized. Version 0.2.182 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may reset the token signing key to be a random value, which will invalidate active personal access tokens.|March 20, 2024; 5:15:32 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29037

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

CVE-2024-29180|"Prior to versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.

Developers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing."|March 21, 2024; 1:15:09 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29180

CVE-2024-29184|"FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to defacement of the Application.

Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue."|March 22, 2024; 1:15:08 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29184
CVE-2024-29185|FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed.

CVE-2024-29186|"Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total maximum size of ~10KB.

CVE-2024-29190|Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In version 3.9.5 Beta and prior, MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in `android:host`, so requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This can lead to server-side request forgery. An attacker can cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure.

CVE-2024-29192|"gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication, an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application, and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF, it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a ""drive-by"" attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config`, which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance.

CVE-2024-29735|Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories|March 26, 2024; 1:15:47 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. 3.0 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.2.2.Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.|April 02, 2024; 4:15:09 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-29902|Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer.

CVE-2024-29903|Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests.

CVE-2024-30252|Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.|April 04, 2024; 3:15:08 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-30255|Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. As a workaround, disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.|April 04, 2024; 4:15:08 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31204|mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk. Version 2024-04 contains a fix for the issue.|April 04, 2024; 5:15:16 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

When a user provides an empty string in `refreshToken` mutation, while the token persists in `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` cookie, application omits validation against CSRF token and returns valid access token.

CVE-2024-31210|WordPress is an open publishing platform for the Web. It's possible for a file of a type other than a zip file to be submitted as a new plugin by an administrative user on the Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin screen in WordPress. If FTP credentials are requested for installation (in order to move the file into place outside of the `uploads` directory) then the uploaded file remains temporary available in the Media Library despite it not being allowed. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant is set to `true` on the site _and_ FTP credentials are required when uploading a new theme or plugin, then this technically allows an RCE when the user would otherwise have no means of executing arbitrary PHP code. This issue _only_ affects Administrator level users on single site installations, and Super Admin level users on Multisite installations where it's otherwise expected that the user does not have permission to upload or execute arbitrary PHP code. Lower level users are not affected. Sites where the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is set to `true` are not affected. Sites where an administrative user either does not need to enter FTP credentials or they have access to the valid FTP credentials, are not affected. The issue was fixed in WordPress 6.4.3 on January 30, 2024 and backported to versions 6.3.3, 6.2.4, 6.1.5, 6.0.7, 5.9.9, 5.8.9, 5.7.11, 5.6.13, 5.5.14, 5.4.15, 5.3.17, 5.2.20, 5.1.18, 5.0.21, 4.9.25, 2.8.24, 4.7.28, 4.6.28, 4.5.31, 4.4.32, 4.3.33, 4.2.37, and 4.1.40.

If the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is defined as `true` then it will not be possible for any user to upload a plugin and therefore this issue will not be exploitable.|April 04, 2024; 7:15:16 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

Attackers have full control over the file contents, full control over the directory where the file is stored, full control over the file extension, and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file, an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, XSS, DOS, etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default, allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges, allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default, as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably.|April 10, 2024; 2:15:07 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31218|Webhood is a self-hosted URL scanner used analyzing phishing and malicious sites. Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account. The Pocketbase admin API does not check for authentication/authorization when creating an admin account when no admin accounts have been added. In its default deployment, Webhood does not create a database admin account. Therefore, unless users have manually created an admin account in the database, an admin account will not exist in the deployment and the deployment is vulnerable. Versions starting from 0.9.1 are patched. The patch creates a randomly generated admin account if admin accounts have not already been created i.e. the vulnerability is exploitable in the deployment. As a workaround, users can disable access to URL path starting with `/api/admins` entirely. With this workaround, the vulnerability is not exploitable via network.|April 05, 2024; 11:15:07 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31391|"Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the ""solr"" and ""admin"" accounts for use by end-users, and a ""k8s-oper"" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes ""event"" containing the username and password of the ""k8s-oper"" account.Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`."|April 12, 2024; 11:15:26 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31461|Plane, an open-source project management tool, has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in versions prior to 0.17-dev. This issue may allow an attacker to send arbitrary requests from the server hosting the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact of this vulnerability includes, but is not limited to, unauthorized access to internal services accessible from the server, potential leakage of sensitive information from internal services, manipulation of internal systems by interacting with internal APIs. Version 0.17-dev contains a patch for this issue. Those who are unable to update immediately may mitigate the issue by restricting outgoing network connections from servers hosting the application to essential services only and/or implementing strict input validation on URLs or parameters that are used to generate server-side requests.|April 10, 2024; 2:15:07 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31462|stable-diffusion-webui is a web interface for Stable Diffusion, implemented using Gradio library. Stable-diffusion-webui 1.7.0 is vulnerable to a limited file write affecting Windows systems. The create_ui method (Backup/Restore tab) in modules/ui_extensions.py takes user input into the config_save_name variable on line 653. This user input is later used in the save_config_state method and used to create a file path on line 65, which is afterwards opened for writing on line 67, which leads to a limited file write exploitable on Windows systems. This issue may lead to limited file write. It allows for writing json files anywhere on the server where the web server has access.|April 12, 2024; 6:15:07 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31463|Ironic-image is an OpenStack Ironic deployment packaged and configured by Metal3. When the reverse proxy mode is enabled by the `IRONIC_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` variable set to `true`, 1) HTTP basic credentials are validated on the HTTPD side in a separate container, not in the Ironic service itself and 2) Ironic listens in host network on a private port 6388 on localhost by default. As a result, when the reverse proxy mode is used, any Pod or local Unix user on the control plane Node can access the Ironic API on the private port without authentication. A similar problem affects Ironic Inspector (`INSPECTOR_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` set to `true`), although the attack potential is smaller there. This issue affects operators deploying ironic-image in the reverse proxy mode, which is the recommended mode when TLS is used (also recommended), with the `IRONIC_PRIVATE_PORT` variable unset or set to a numeric value. In this case, an attacker with enough privileges to launch a pod on the control plane with host networking can access Ironic API and use it to modify bare-metal machine, e.g. provision them with a new image or change their BIOS settings. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.1.1. |April 17, 2024; 12:15:08 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31464|XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, it is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they have rights to edit the users' page.  With the default right scheme in XWiki this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of those pages. There is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again, this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right). A page with a user password xobject which have in its history a revision where the object has been deleted should be considered at risk and the password should be changed there. a diff, to ensure it's not coming from a password field. As another mitigation, admins should ensure that the user pages are properly protected: the edit right shouldn't be allowed for other users than Admin and owner of the profile (which is the default right). There is not much workaround possible for a privileged user other than upgrading XWiki.|April 10, 2024; 3:15:49 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31497|In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.|April 15, 2024; 4:15:11 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-31991|Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response, it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function, nor those that call it, add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided, nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e., an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response, it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server, and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password.

CVE-2024-31992|Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server, however these requests are not rate-limited. While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container.

CVE-2024-31993|Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner.

The response from the Mealie server will also vary depending on whether or not the target file is an image, is not an image, or does not exist. Additionally, when a file is retrieved the file may remain stored on Mealie’s file system as original.jpg under the UUID of the recipe it was requested for. If the attacker has access to an admin account (e.g. the default changeme@example.com), this file can then be retrieved. Note that if Mealie is running in a development setting this could be leveraged by an attacker to retrieve any file that the Mealie server had downloaded in this fashion without the need for administrator access.

CVE-2024-31994|Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, an attacker can point the image request to an arbitrarily large file. Mealie will attempt to retrieve this file in whole. If it can be retrieved, it may be stored on the file system in whole (leading to possible disk consumption), however the more likely scenario given resource limitations is that the container will OOM during file retrieval if the target file size is greater than the allocated memory of the container. At best this can be used to force the container to infinitely restart due to OOM (if so configured in `docker-compose.yml), or at worst this can be used to force the Mealie container to crash and remain offline. In the event that the file can be retrieved, the lack of rate limiting on this endpoint also permits an attacker to generate ongoing requests to any target of their choice, potentially contributing to an external-facing DoS attack.

CVE-2024-31999|"@festify/secure-session creates a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify. At the end of the request handling, it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that, the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests, it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session, but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code, when the session is deleted, it is marked for deletion. However, if an attacker could gain access to the cookie, they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2024-32003|wn-dusk-plugin (Dusk plugin) is a plugin which integrates Laravel Dusk browser testing into Winter CMS. The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]` is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User plugin). If a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication. As indicated in the `README`, this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development dependency only in Composer. In order to remediate this issue, the special routes used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer manually specifies it in their configuration. The automatic configuration performed by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration. This will only affect users in which the Winter CMS installation meets ALL the following criteria: 1. The Dusk plugin is installed in the Winter CMS instance. 2. The application is in production mode (ie. the `debug` config value is set to `true` in `config/app.php`). 3. The Dusk plugin's automatic configuration has been overridden, either by providing a custom `.env.dusk` file or by providing custom configuration in the `config/dusk` folder, or by providing configuration environment variables externally. 4. The environment has been configured to use production data in the database for testing, and not the temporary SQLite database that Dusk uses by default. 5. The application is connectable via the web.

CVE-2024-32462|Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.|April 18, 2024; 2:15:09 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-32473|Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.|April 18, 2024; 6:15:10 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or more.|April 18, 2024; 4:15:17 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-32475|Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. When an upstream TLS cluster is used with `auto_sni` enabled, a request containing a `host`/`:authority` header longer than 255 characters triggers an abnormal termination of Envoy process. Envoy does not gracefully handle an error when setting SNI for outbound TLS connection. The error can occur when Envoy attempts to use the `host`/`:authority` header value longer than 255 characters as SNI for outbound TLS connection. SNI length is limited to 255 characters per the standard. Envoy always expects this operation to succeed and abnormally aborts the process when it fails. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.30.1, 1.29.4, 1.28.3, and 1.27.5.|April 18, 2024; 11:15:30 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-32477|Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input, it's possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Deno permission policy.  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.42.2.|April 18, 2024; 4:15:17 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-32481|Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.|April 25, 2024; 1:15:50 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

CVE-2024-32644|Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions >=V17.0.0.|April 19, 2024; 11:15:50 AM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system.

CVE-2024-32876|NewPipe is an Android app for video streaming written in Java. It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS.The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges.All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).|April 24, 2024; 3:15:47 PM -0400|"V3.x:(not available)

However, some local environment variables may have been set by the developer / CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during the application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application. It leads to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values.||||
Mitigation:||||
The attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for verification,no easy way to automatically check that; and uses webhooks by a service that uses Svix, and then figure out a way to craft a malicious payload that will actually include all of the correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual issues.|February 13, 2024; 12:15:08 AM -0500|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21491|
