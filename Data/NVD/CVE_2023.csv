CVE-2023-52617,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call
to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
trailing put_device(), just before return.

At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted
one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.

Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
future accidents.

Lukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the
problem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following
discussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on
this problem:
- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller
  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through
  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes
- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is
  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form
- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming
  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO
  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH
  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will
  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation
  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)

Use multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the
number of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one
MMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than
the hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in
one MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error
is gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes
from the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that
or because multiple packets have been aggregated).

In case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we
need to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the
card will return corrupt data for the next rtw_sdio_read_port() call.","March 18, 2024; 7:15:08 AM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52611
CVE-2023-52610,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags

act_ct adds skb->users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order,
the last frag's reference is reset in:

  inet_frag_reasm_prepare
    skb_morph

which is not straightforward.

However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and
all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet
capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the
same time.

Fix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct
returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.

CVE-2023-52609,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()

Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.

  Task A            | Task B
  ------------------+------------------
  mmget_not_zero()  |
                    |  do_exit()
                    |    exit_mm()
                    |      mmput()
  mmput()           |
    exit_mmap()     |
      remove_vma()  |
        fput()      |

In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
from Task B that never comes (it's dead).

This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
death notifications will also be delayed until then.

In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.","March 18, 2024; 7:15:07 AM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52609

""Local sync"" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git. An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass by removing `applications, create` RBAC access.

CVE-2023-52608,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency

On reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed
to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence
number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related
payload is fetched too.

When an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the
platform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence,
any further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel
to be relinquished by the platform.

Once that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back
to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and
overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait
for the reply to the new request starts.

It has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can
be wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens
the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the
message header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending
transaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive.

This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the
channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the
channel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ.

Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR.","March 13, 2024; 10:15:07 AM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52608

  ......

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.","March 11, 2024; 2:15:16 PM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52490

mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage

The below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory
region with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that
[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end
pfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered
will try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because
pfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When
from other core, the section mappings are being removed for the
ZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which
compaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash
with CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].

compact_zone()			memunmap_pages

     valid_section()//return true
			      (b)__remove_pages()->

				    [Free the array ms->usage and set
				     ms->usage = NULL]
     pfn_section_valid()
     [Access ms->usage which
     is NULL]

NOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between
the pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with
SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

The commit b943f045a9af(""mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with
pfn_section_valid check"") tried to address the same problem by clearing
the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns
false thus ms->usage is not accessed.

Fix this issue by the below steps:

a) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage.

b) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL
   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage.

c) Free the ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL.  No
   attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the
   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.

Thanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.

serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the
initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data
without having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the
IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.

The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write
from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on
the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled
manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these
functions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the
cache accordingly.

Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to
remove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the
_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so
cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.","March 11, 2024; 2:15:16 PM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52488

The cited change refactored mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() to only clear DUP
flag when list of peer flows has become empty. However, if any concurrent
user holds a reference to a peer flow (for example, the neighbor update
workqueue task is updating peer flow's parent encap entry concurrently),
then the flow will not be removed from the peer list and, consecutively,
DUP flag will remain set. Since mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peers_flow() calls
mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() for every possible peer index the algorithm
will try to remove the flow from eswitch instances that it has never peered
with causing either NULL pointer dereference when trying to remove the flow
peer list head of peer_index that was never initialized or a warning if the
list debug config is enabled[0].

Fix the issue by always removing the peer flow from the list even when not
releasing the last reference to it.

CVE-2023-52486,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling

If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl()
we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top.
But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL, and so if we then
get another error during the retry, before the fb lookup, we proceed
the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference.
The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed
while it's still in use.

Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again
until we've done another fb lookup.

This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async
flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I
saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking
the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops
instead, and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.","March 11, 2024; 2:15:16 PM -0400",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52486

CVE-2023-48703,"RobotsAndPencils go-saml, a SAML client library written in Go, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in all known versions. This is due to how the `xmlsec1` command line tool is called internally to verify the signature of SAML assertions. When `xmlsec1` is used without defining the enabled key data, the origin of the public key for the signature verification is, unfortunately, not restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions themselves and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key) directly embedded in the SAML token. Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects. The vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed by forking the go-saml project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the `xmlsec1` binary in the verify function.

solves this issue.

As the function returns a void, good error handling

s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctly

If the content of the floating point control (fpc) register of a traced

validity by temporarily loading it into the fpc register.

This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the tracing process:
if an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the
fpc register, and within interrupt context floating point or vector
registers are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with
save_fpu_regs() assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into
fp/vx registers when returning to user space.

test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space fpc register value, however
it will be discarded, when returning to user space.

was supposed to be used for the traced process.

the interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the
ISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured

This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
disables the streaming might do things that conflict.

Fix this by keeping the lock held and changing to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent
eventual sleeps.
Unfortunately we could not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix but
based on the code review I think this fix should address such lockups.

Add a mutex lock to control vblank irq to synchronize vblank
enable/disable operations happening from different threads to prevent
race conditions while registering/unregistering the vblank irq callback.

v4: -Removed vblank_ctl_lock from dpu_encoder_virt, so it is only a
    parameter of dpu_encoder_phys.
    -Switch from atomic refcnt to a simple int counter as mutex has
    now been added
v3: Mistakenly did not change wording in last version. It is done now.

spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove

The pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along with
spmi_controller.
On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres
, including the clocks, will be cleanup.
This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks in
the pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.

This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and
building the kernel with KASAN.

Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the
clocks before freeing spmi_controller.","March 06, 2024; 2:15:07 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52584

CVE-2023-52582,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio

If a network filesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length()
function, it can set subrequest lengths smaller than a page size.

When we loop through the folios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to
set any folios to be written back, we need to make sure we only
call folio_start_fscache() once for each folio.

Otherwise, this simple testcase:

  mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file.bin bs=4096 count=1

net/core: Fix ETH_P_1588 flow dissector

When a PTP ethernet raw frame with a size of more than 256 bytes followed
by a 0xff pattern is sent to __skb_flow_dissect, nhoff value calculation
is wrong. For example: hdr->message_length takes the wrong value (0xffff)
and it does not replicate real header length. In this case, 'nhoff' value
was overridden and the PTP header was badly dissected. This leads to a
kernel crash.

net/core: flow_dissector
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0000000e
net/core flow dissector hdr->message_length = 0x0000ffff

Using the size of the ptp_header struct will allow the corrected
calculation of the nhoff value.

btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item

Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item
into the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we
have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before
calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
snapshots in the transaction commit path).

So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.

This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it because
it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehow
we attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.","March 02, 2024; 5:15:49 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52569
CVE-2023-52568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race

The SGX EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an
enclave and set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG
and ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for
secs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.

Fix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as
needed for both EAUG and ELDU.

The SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed
when there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,
virtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is
paged back in.

An enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS
page. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race
with paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A
triggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS
both are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.

Hitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.
Following is a trace when it happens.

CVE-2023-52567,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250_port: Check IRQ data before use

In case the leaf driver wants to use IRQ polling (irq = 0) and
IIR register shows that an interrupt happened in the 8250 hardware
the IRQ data can be NULL. In such a case we need to skip the wake
event as we came to this path from the timer interrupt and quite
likely system is already awake.

Without this fix we have got an Oops:

CVE-2023-52566,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()

In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(), brelse(bh) is called to drop the
reference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If
the reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked, bh may be
freed.  However, bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that,
which may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release
operation after unlocking and putting the page.

NOTE: The function in question is only called in GC, and in combination
with current userland tools, address translation using DAT does not occur
in that function, so the code path that causes this issue will not be
executed.  However, it is possible to run that code path by intentionally
modifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.

Revert ""tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux""

This reverts commit 9b9c8195f3f0d74a826077fc1c01b9ee74907239.

The commit above is reverted as it did not solve the original issue.

gsm_cleanup_mux() tries to free up the virtual ttys by calling
gsm_dlci_release() for each available DLCI. There, dlci_put() is called to
decrease the reference counter for the DLCI via tty_port_put() which
finally calls gsm_dlci_free(). This already clears the pointer which is
being checked in gsm_cleanup_mux() before calling gsm_dlci_release().
Therefore, it is not necessary to clear this pointer in gsm_cleanup_mux()
as done in the reverted commit. The commit introduces a null pointer
dereference:

CVE-2023-52562,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()

After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does not
release all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmod
time), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing it
from the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()
ignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removes
the kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() fails
to release all of the cache's slabs.

This is easily observable on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y
as after that ill release the system will immediately trip on list_add,
or list_del, assertions similar to the one shown below as soon as another
kmem_cache gets created, or destroyed:

This issue is caused because usbnet_read_cmd() reads less bytes than requested
(zero byte in the reproducer). In this case, 'buf' is not properly filled.

This patch fixes the issue by returning -ENODATA if usbnet_read_cmd() reads
less bytes than requested.","March 02, 2024; 5:15:48 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52528
CVE-2023-52527,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4, ipv6: Fix handling of transhdrlen in __ip{,6}_append_data()

Including the transhdrlen in length is a problem when the packet is
partially filled (e.g. something like send(MSG_MORE) happened previously)
when appending to an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as we don't want to repeat the
transport header or account for it twice.  This can happen under some
circumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.

The symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data():

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800 __ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800

that occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an already
partially occupied skbuff.  The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger than
the amount of data in the message iterator.  This is because the requested
length includes the transport header length when it shouldn't.  This can be
triggered by, for example:

        sfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP);
        bind(sfd, ...); // ::1
        connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7
        send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);
        sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024);

Fix this by only adding transhdrlen into the length if the write queue is
empty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(), analogously to how UDP does things.

l2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it won't suffer from this problem as it builds
the UDP packet itself.","March 02, 2024; 5:15:48 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52527

CVE-2023-52523,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Reject sk_msg egress redirects to non-TCP sockets

With a SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH map and an sk_msg program user can steer messages
sent from one TCP socket (s1) to actually egress from another TCP
socket (s2):

tcp_bpf_sendmsg(s1)		// = sk_prot->sendmsg
  tcp_bpf_send_verdict(s1)	// __SK_REDIRECT case
    tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir(s2)

	  tcp_sendmsg_locked(s2)	 // ditto

There is a hard-coded assumption in the call-chain, that the egress
socket (s2) is a TCP socket.

However in commit 122e6c79efe1 (""sock_map: Update sock type checks for
UDP"") we have enabled redirects to non-TCP sockets. This was done for the
sake of BPF sk_skb programs. There was no indention to support sk_msg
send-to-egress use case.

As a result, attempts to send-to-egress through a non-TCP socket lead to a
crash due to invalid downcast from sock to tcp_sock:

spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain

Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to
read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is
correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the
transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be
transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO
still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure
and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO, corrupting any data
read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to
DMA progress in DMA mode, thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA
mode is a bug.
Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode.
Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to
ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.","March 02, 2024; 5:15:47 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52517

The reason is early memblock_reserve() in memblock_init() set node id to
MAX_NUMNODES, making NODE_DATA(nid) a NULL dereference in the call chain
reserve_bootmem_region() -> init_reserved_page(). After memblock_init(),
those late calls of memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock
.memory regions. As a result, these reserved regions will be set to the
correct node at the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages().

So set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid this
panic.","March 02, 2024; 5:15:47 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52506

ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past ""commit""

When iterating over the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active, the
writer can corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and

The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the
length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the
length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process
of updating that code, there's a small window where the length in the first
4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will
cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the
allocated page.

The problem is in ret_from_syscall where the check for
icache_44x_need_flush is done. When the flush is needed the code jumps
out-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue
the syscall return.

However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correct

causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.

The breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc

inadvertently removed the ""1"" label and reused it elsewhere.

erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression

Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace
decompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages of
compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.

However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compressed
data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it
explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:
  __________________________________________________________
 |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|

Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps two
individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.
Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for
short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to
completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported
that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.
After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the new
FSRM feature expose this issue with ""rep movsb"".

Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace
decompression for now.  Later, as an useful improvement, we could try

Note that since 6.6-rc1 the arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range above is renamed
to ""arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs"", yet the problem remains.

The commit 06ff87bae8d3 (""arm64: mm: remove unused functions and variable
protoypes"") fixed a similar lockup on the CPU MMU side. Yet, it can occur
to SMMU too, since arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is called
typically next to MMU tlb flush function, e.g.
	tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly {
		tlb_flush {
			__flush_tlb_range {
				// check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
		mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
			arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
				// does not check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
	}

Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in tlbflush.h, since in an
SVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it makes sense to align with the
tlbflush code. Then, replace per-page TLBI commands with a single per-asid
TLBI command, if the request size hits this threshold.","February 29, 2024; 1:15:46 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52484

arm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround

Implement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an
affected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load
might leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The
issue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the same
translation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects
the return to EL0.

The workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all
loads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is
sufficient.

The workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is
enabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should
normally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature
and the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is enabled).","February 29, 2024; 1:15:46 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52481

HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect

hidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)
races when it races with itself.

hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs
on probe() and if a ""device-connected"" packet is received by the hw
when the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on
the hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be
started from the workqueue.

This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):

1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):

	if (!hidpp->protocol_major) {
		hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()
		hidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];
	}

We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output
attached to rhbz#2227968:

[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.

Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads
take turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong
through all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:

2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):

	if (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {
		...
		hidpp->name = new_name;
	}

3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):

hidpp_initialize_battery()
{
        if (hidpp->battery.ps)
                return 0;

	probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);
}

4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):

	if (hidpp->delayed_input)
		return;

	hidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);

The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following
sequence:

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);

	...

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);

So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,
which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even
the really big problem.

Notice how:

1. This is all devm-maganaged
2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies
3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second
   devm_kmemdup()

This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:
1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered
2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,
   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory
3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,
   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes
   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data
4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which
   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:

perf/x86/lbr: Filter vsyscall addresses

We found that a panic can occur when a vsyscall is made while LBR sampling
is active. If the vsyscall is interrupted (NMI) for perf sampling, this
call sequence can occur (most recent at top):

    __insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_prefixes()

    peek_nbyte_next(insn_byte_t, insn, i)

Within this macro, this dereference occurs:

Inspecting registers at this point, the value of the next_byte field is the
address of the vsyscall made, for example the location of the vsyscall
version of gettimeofday() at 0xffffffffff600000. The access to an address
in the vsyscall region will trigger an oops due to an unhandled page fault.

Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete

syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This
happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from
the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message
completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not
exist anymore and hence the bug.

Use usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon
device disconnection.

CVE-2023-52474,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests

hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data
corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs
where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page
boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a

Here are the specific bugs:
1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len.
   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec
   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past
   iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.
2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the
   next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec
   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the
   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the
   iovec pages.

This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2
because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail
iovec of an SDMA request.

Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache
(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests
with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So
this commit fixes those issues as well.

Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec
payload user SDMA requests can hit:
1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate
   pinnings.
2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),
   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)
   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock
   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.

   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)
   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.

   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the
   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between
   (2) and (3).
3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is
   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node
   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and
   checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is
   incremented.
4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not
   check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.

   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have
   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the
   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests
   complete.","February 26, 2024; 1:15:07 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52474

CVE-2023-52452,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots

Privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack
memory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses
were permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted
above state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the
stack was already ""large enough"", the access was permitted, but
otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to ""grow the
stack"". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:
- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()
- in check_stack_range_initialized()
This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests
that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were
changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior
persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it
can't run unprivileged for other reasons.

This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset
reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one
because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack
using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers
with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the
function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program
to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime
because a too small stack had been allocated for it.

Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in
bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by
update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()
was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed
part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was
incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used
instead.

This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in
grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to
check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is
now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.

powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array

dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
&drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the

Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],

In the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),
and access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,
gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the
ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.

The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI
volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].
Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from
creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the
type MTD_UBIVOLUME.","February 22, 2024; 12:15:08 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52449

bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary

When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map
may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.
However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a
RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes,
the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
use-after-free problem.

Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both
one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner
map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is
accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when
releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head
field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to
reduce the size of bpf_map.","February 22, 2024; 12:15:08 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52447

It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment ""a ns name without a following profile is allowed""
inside.

AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked ""name"" to be in form like
"":samba-dcerpcd"" - it is passed from userspace.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with

Sites that have configured their application's account type to any options other than `Accounts in this organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`.

binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback

The mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which means
that using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().
As of commit dd2283f2605e (""mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.

I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and
triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The
following KASAN report confirms the UAF:

Fix this issue by performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to
find the vma that was isolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note that
this option has better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lock
which would increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been
recently removed anyway.","February 20, 2024; 4:15:08 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52438

GSO_BY_FRAGS is a forbidden value, but unfortunately the following
computation in skb_segment() can reach it quite easily :

	mss = mss * partial_segs;

65535 = 3 * 5 * 17 * 257, so many initial values of mss can lead to
a bad final result.

Make sure to limit segmentation so that the new mss value is smaller

CVE-2023-51447,"Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.27.0 and prior to versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0, the dynamic file upload feature is subject to potential cross-site scripting attacks in case the attacker manages to modify the file names of the records being uploaded to the server. This appears in sections where the user controls the file upload dialogs themselves and has the technical knowledge to change the file names through the dynamic upload endpoint. Therefore I believe it would require the attacker to control the whole session of the particular user but in any case, this needs to be fixed. Successful exploit of this vulnerability would require the user to have successfully uploaded a file blob to the server with a malicious file name and then have the possibility to direct the other user to the edit page of the record where the attachment is attached. The users are able to craft the direct upload requests themselves controlling the file name that gets stored to the database. The attacker is able to change the filename e.g. to `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>` if they know how to craft these requests themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form inputs manually by modifying the edit page source. Versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 contain a patch for this issue.

Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem, the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 of the `decidim,` `decidim-admin`, and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password reset functionality, the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected.

Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path. 





    
    
            






    
    
            This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .

In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.","February 14, 2024; 10:15:08 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5123

CVE-2023-6516,"To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.

CVE-2023-50292,"Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.

The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the ""trust"" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are ""trusted"" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their ""trust"" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.","February 09, 2024; 1:15:08 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50292
CVE-2023-50291,"Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had ""password"" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as ""basicauth"" and ""aws.secretKey"" do not contain ""password"", thus their values were published via the ""/admin/info/properties"" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the ""config-read"" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the ""config-read"" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, ""-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps"".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including ""-Dbasicauth""), as well as any property with a name containing ""secret"" or ""password"".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:

CVE-2023-51702,"Since version 5.2.0, when using deferrable mode with the path of a Kubernetes configuration file for authentication, the Airflow worker serializes this configuration file as a dictionary and sends it to the triggerer by storing it in metadata without any encryption.

CVE-2023-47115,"Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.

The file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed.

Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.","January 23, 2024; 6:15:08 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47115

In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users.","January 23, 2024; 9:15:37 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49783

CVE-2023-44401,"The Silverstripe CMS GraphQL Server serves Silverstripe data as GraphQL representations. In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0 prior to 5.1.3, `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page. Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and 5.1.3 by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in the query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly. One may disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin.","January 23, 2024; 9:15:37 AM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44401

CVE-2023-6129,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.","January 09, 2024; 12:15:12 PM -0500",https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6129
